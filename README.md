# Todo List Application (React Native)

## Overview
This **React Native Todo List application** allows users to add  **groups**. Users can perform **CRUD operations** (Create,Update,Delete) and they can delete a group also. The app has **login and signup functionality** for user authentication, and it uses **SQLite** as the local database for storing data.

## Challenges Encountered
1. **SQLite Integration**: Ensuring smooth crud operations was difficult for me because i have never used SQLite before.
2. **NativeWind Integration**: Like i faced a lot of problem in integrating nativewid in tsx version so finally i opted for javascript version.
